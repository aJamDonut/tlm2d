Put your tileset image folders under this `public/` directory using the same relative paths referenced by level1.json.

For example, if level1.json references:
  2D HD Zombie City Tileset/Isometric Tiles/Ground A1_N.png

Then place the image at:
  public/2D HD Zombie City Tileset/Isometric Tiles/Ground A1_N.png

These files will be served by Vite at URLs like:
  /2D%20HD%20Zombie%20City%20Tileset/Isometric%20Tiles/Ground%20A1_N.png
